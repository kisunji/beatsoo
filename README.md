JS project that maps sounds to key presses. Clone and open index.html in a browser to start.
Originally a project from https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/

Added mouseclick events to trigger an inside joke

## Personal reflection
This project was my first time using a javascript library and having to look up the API to add a feature I wanted. I want to make a habit of adding my personal enhancements to go beyond the basics that I learn in tutorials.
